# SDI to MIPI CSI-2 bridge

## Description

Open source SDI to MIPI CSI-2 bridge. This device allows you to connect SDI inputs over long distances using a single coaxial cable to the otherwise short-range (but extremely popular and widely available) MIPI CSI-2 interface. Compatible with the (Jetson Nano Baseboard).
